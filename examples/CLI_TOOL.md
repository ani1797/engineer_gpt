I want to build a Python CLI tool that allows me to modify git config file and allow for easily switching user.name, user.email and user.siginingKey properties so that I don't have to modify them manually everytime. It should allow me for running a command in terminal and then prompt me for available users. Once I select the user available, it should modify the configs to refect the selected user.
